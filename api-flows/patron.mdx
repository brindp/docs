The Patron's user journey follows the customer to browse available dishes by category on the food ordering app and place an order.

1. Patron browses the available dishes by category (appetizers, main course, drinks, and desserts).
2. The client app ensures the essential ingredients for the dish are in stock.
3. Patron views the dish details prior to ordering.
4. Patron adds dishes and views cart.
5. Patron places the order in the system.
6. Patron gets a confirmation that the order has been successfully placed.

## Step 1 - Browse Dishes

The patron uses the food ordering app to browse the available dishes by category (appetizers, main course, drinks, and desserts).

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to retrieve a list of dishes filtered by the selected category.

```powershell
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/dishes?filter=category.eq~Appetizer&fields=name|description|ingredients
```

**Query Parameters**

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description                                               |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| filter | string | No       | Filter expression (e.g., category.eq~Appetizer)           |
| Fields | string | No       | Pipe-separated list of foelds to include in the response. |

### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code with the response body containing the dish details. The client now has the data it needs to populate the dish details page.
