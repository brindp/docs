The Patron's user journey allows the customer to browse available dishes by category on the food ordering app and place an order.

## Step 1 - Browse Dishes

The patron uses the food ordering app to browse the available dishes by category (appetizers, main course, drinks, and desserts).

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to retrieve a list of dishes filtered by the selected category.

```
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/dishes/{id}?fields=price|image_name|ingredients'
```

> curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/dishes/{id}?fields=price|image_name|ingredients'

<RequestExample>

``` filename
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/dishes/{id}?fields=price|image_name|ingredients'
```

</RequestExample>

### Response

2. Allow the patron to view dish details prior to ordering.
3. Let the patron add a dish to their cart and view it.
4. Create the order in the system.
5. Confirm to the patron the order has been successfully placed.
