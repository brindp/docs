title: "Patron API Flow"

The Patron's user journey allows the customer to browse available dishes by category on the food ordering app and place an order.

## Step 1 - Browse Dishes

The patron uses the food ordering app to browse the available dishes by category (appetizers, main course, drinks, and desserts).

### Request

The client sends an HTTP request to retrieve a list of dishes filtered by the selected category.

```
curl -X GET 'http://{serverUrl}/dishes/{id}?fields=price|image_name|ingredients'
```

### Response

If the request was successful, the server responds with a `200 OK` status code with the response body containing the dish details. The client now has the data it needs to populate the dish details page.
